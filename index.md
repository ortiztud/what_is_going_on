<div style="text-align: right"> <i>Isabelle Ehrlich (2021)</i></div> 

A site like this is easy to build. In here we could have a front page with a brief description, our names and contact info and an index.

And further down there could be something catchy like: 
**Do researchers actually know how to interprete _p values_?**

<iframe src="./interpretation_plot.html"
    sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts"
    width="700"
    height="700"
    scrolling="yes"
    seamless="seamless"
    frameborder="0">
  </iframe>
  <caption>Source: PubMed</caption>
 <div style="text-align: right"> 
The figure above was created with the following PubMed query `(("p value"[Title/Abstract] OR "effect sizes"[Title/Abstract]) AND "interpretation"[Title/Abstract]) AND (2000:2021[pdat])`. </div> 

Regardless of whether researchers do know it or do not, they for sure are talking more and more about it.

[Here](./maths.html) is where you can find how to mathemetically compute everything that we discuss in this site.

We could also have a short quizz to test whether people know what the _p value_ actually means. Something like [this](./quizz.html).

In [this link](./pages/cheat_sheet.html) we can find some useful tips.
