# In (mathematical) depth
In case you are interested in the actual implementation, we got you covered.

In case we would like to use inline expressions, we can use a single $ to delimit an expression:
This expression: $\vec{F} = \frac{d \vec{p}}{dt} = m \frac{d \vec{v}}{dt} = m \vec{a}$


Block Expressions
You can also use block expressions that use $$ as delimiters in a block:
$$
\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} = \binom{n}{k}
$$

Html Markup
You can add math expressions using <div class="math"> syntax as follows:
<div class="math">
\begin{equation}
  \int_0^\infty \frac{x^3}{e^x-1}\,dx = \frac{\pi^4}{15}  
\end{equation}
</div>
